# File Organizer

## Uses and Description

These different `Python` files will help you clean up your computer and declutter it. There are multiple ways to organize files and many people have different preferences. I am creating a `repo` to store different organization techniques into `python` code for people to use individually. Keep in mind that I am a solo dev and may have bugs in my code and am not liable if files are erased or misplaced. All I can say is that my test cases have all passed and the worst that will happen is the program returns an error and the files will not move anywhere.

## Keyword Organizer

This simple `Python` code will help you organize your files into groups. It lets you input the groups you want and then makes those the folders. Subsequently, it sorts the files in the original directory and if the filename contains the keyword, it will add it to that folder. These programs are under the `keywordOrganizer` folder and there is a different program to run whether it your operating system is `Windows` or `Mac OS`.

## Extension Organizer

This simple `Python` code will save you the hassle of sorting through various files to try and sort by extensions. This could be any file extension you can think of. What it will do is go through a specific `path` and callect all the files. Following that, the program will make folders for each `unique extension` inside that directory. Lastly, it will add all of the files to their corresponding extension folder to have a neat directory when finished.
